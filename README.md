## **Key Themes in Chapters 72 and 73**

### **Trust and Mentorship**

One of the key themes explored in Chapters 72 and 73 is the complexity of trust. In Chapter 72, Jaekyung is forced to confront his past and the trust issues that arose from it. In Chapter 73, trust plays a significant role once again, as Jaekyung must decide whether to trust his former coach and reopen old wounds in order to progress. Mentorship, in this context, is shown to be a double-edged swordâ€”while it offers growth and direction, it also requires vulnerability and the willingness to face past mistakes.

### **Personal Growth and Redemption**

Another central theme in these chapters is personal growth and redemption. Jaekyungâ€™s journey is filled with moments of self-doubt and internal conflict, but itâ€™s clear that his desire for growth is what drives him forward. The reappearance of his mentor offers Jaekyung a chance for redemption, a chance to prove to himself that he can overcome his past and become the person he aspires to be. These themes of self-improvement resonate with readers, offering a message of hope and resilience.

### **The Power of Reflection**

Reflection is an important aspect of both chapters. In Chapter 72, Jaekyungâ€™s flashbacks allow himâ€”and the readersâ€”to reflect on the choices that have led him to where he is now. In Chapter 73, Jaekyung reflects on his past with the coach, considering the lessons learned and the emotional baggage he still carries. This theme highlights how reflecting on the past is necessary for moving forward, a sentiment that many readers can relate to in their own lives.
